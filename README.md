**Reflections on IS445 - Data Visualization**

This course offered a practical deep dive into data visualization, which was a new area for me. Coming from a background where I already had some Python skills, this course allowed me to explore and enhance my understanding of different visualization libraries and tools. I particularly appreciated the opportunity to work beyond the basic requirements of the assignments, which encouraged me to experiment with different visual styles and functionalities.

Moreover, the idea of constructing a 'visual library' became a personal project. By cataloging the visualizations I learned, I created a reference that I could revisit. This not only solidified my learning but also prepared me for future projects where these skills would be invaluable.

The course also highlighted the importance of foundational programming skills. It became clear that having a grounding in basic programming was crucial to fully leverage the capabilities of data visualization tools. This insight has led me to believe that there should be a more defined pathway for students entering visualization courses—perhaps by establishing prerequisites that ensure students are adequately prepared or by offering parallel tracks that cater to different skill levels.

**Suggestions for Professor Uhe**

Professor Uhe’s course structure and teaching methods were very effective, especially the clear explanations and the practical application of libraries on real data sets. To make the course even more beneficial, it could be helpful to adjust the content to cater more specifically to students at different skill levels. Additional resources that provide deeper insights into when and why to use certain visualization tools/techniques over others would be a great supplement.  environments.

To make the course more engaging and comprehensive, we could expand the discussions beyond basic design principles to include a deeper dive into advanced tools and resources that can enhance our visualizations. This approach would not only improve the aesthetics of our projects but also their functionality and the way they present data.

Another great addition would be regular discussions on the latest developments and interesting events in the world of data visualization. Bringing in current trends and real-world applications would make the learning process more relevant and exciting. It would also provide insights into how professionals are using these tools and techniques in different sectors.

Finally, increasing the amount of group work in the course could greatly benefit us. More collaborative projects would give us practical experience working with others, mirroring the teamwork required in professional environments. This would also allow us to learn from our peers, gaining diverse perspectives and problem-solving strategies.
